# Background Image Setup

## Adding Your Gothic Chess Queen Background

To use the gothic chess queen image as your background:

1. **Save your image** as `background.jpg` in the `public/` folder
2. **Recommended dimensions**: 1920x1080 or larger for best quality
3. **File location**: `/public/background.jpg`

## Current Fallback

The website currently uses a gothic-themed fallback background with:
- Dark chess board pattern
- Burgundy and black color scheme
- Atmospheric gradients
- Gothic aesthetic elements

## How It Works

The CSS is set up to:
1. First try to load your `background.jpg` image
2. If the image isn't found, fall back to the gothic pattern
3. Apply a dark overlay for better text readability
4. Maintain the gothic color scheme throughout

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: At least 1920x1080 pixels
- **Aspect ratio**: 16:9 recommended
- **File size**: Under 2MB for optimal loading

Once you add your image, the website will automatically use it as the background while maintaining all the gothic styling and Mac OS interface elements!
